Things to fix in the future:

1- make a backend which will contact League of legends API, so I can retrieve status code when request fails. 

7- I need to check if I should move my API call to the store??? 


CSS ideas:

1- I need to implement responsive design (mobile phone only with media query). (check mydevice.io => calculate 'usual' size for mobile device). Then i will set a media query min width to that 'usual' size


Documentation:

1- Make a doc file

2- Explain how to get/refresh API key and where to do it
