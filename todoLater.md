Things to fix in the future:

1- All abilities video don't have the same url link. 99% of them end with '.webm' but I found at least one with '.mp4'

2- I need to remove all inline css (especially in DisplaySkins component)

3- I need pagination in ChallengerRanking component if I want to fetch icon summoner (otherwise error 429 too many requests)

4- I need to remove console.log(error) and show error message instead

5- I need to implement spinner ou something similar

6- I need to refactor components ChampionMastery and ChestObtained, they are very similar (just one filter difference + text info)
