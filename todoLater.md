Things to fix in the future:

~~4- I need to remove console.log(error) and show error message instead~~ need to find how to get error.response from axios to get status code

7- I need to check if i should move my API call to the store??? 


CSS ideas:

3- I need to implement responsive design (mobile phone only with media query). (check mydevice.io => calculate 'usual' size for mobile device). Then i will set a media query min width to that 'usual' size

5- I need to add 4 more animated background image, 1 per section on home page

Documentation:

1- Make a doc file

2- Explain how to get/refresh API key and where to do it
